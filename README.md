# loan-approval-prediction
This project focuses on predicting loan approval using machine learning techniques. It begins with loading and exploring a dataset containing various borrower attributes such as income, loan amount, education, and credit score. Data preprocessing and visualization are performed to understand patterns influencing loan approval. The core of the project involves training a logistic regression model to classify whether a loan application will be approved or rejected based on the input features. Performance metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report are used to evaluate the modelâ€™s effectiveness. This predictive model helps financial institutions make informed lending decisions efficiently.
